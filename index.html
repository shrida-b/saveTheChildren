    <!-- intro information -->
    <h3>Roughly 160 million children have been subjected to child labour in the past year.</h3>
    <p> Around the globe, children are exploited in the forms of paid and unpaid work harmful to them. These children are engaged in child labour, when they are too young to be involved in hazardous activities that may stunt or damage their educational, mental, societal, or physical development. </p>

    <!-- ILO information -->
    <p> The International Labor Organization defines child labor as work that: </p>
    <ul class = "bullets">
      <li class = "bulletsList">- obliges them to leave school prematurely</li>
      <li class = "bulletsList">- is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children</li>
      <li class = "bulletsList">- intereferes with their schooling by depriving them of the opportunity to attend school; </li>
      <li class = "bulletsList">- or requires them to attempt to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The ILO also states that: <br></br>
    <i>“In its most extreme forms, child labour involves children being enslaved, separated from their families, exposed to serious hazards and illnesses and/or left to fend for themselves on the streets of large cities – often at a very early age. Whether or not particular forms of ‘work’ can be called ‘child labour’ depends on the child’s age, the type and hours of work performed, the conditions under which it is performed and the objectives pursued by individual countries.”</i></p>
